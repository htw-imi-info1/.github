# Info1 @ HTW Berlin

this organisation contains source code for the class Informatics 1 for the Bachelor Media Informatics, HTW Berlin.

See [https://home.htw-berlin.de/~kleinen/info1](https://home.htw-berlin.de/~kleinen/info1).

**To find the Repository you are looking for, either follow the links from the [Webpage above](https://home.htw-berlin.de/~kleinen/info1) or go to the full list of Repositorys below which sorts by "last updated" by default - usually you'll find the current repos there, as I just updated them. 

("Popular Repositories" is of no use unless you need to catch up on last week's exercises ;-) )
